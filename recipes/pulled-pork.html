    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pulled pork is an easy, almost fool-proof (dont ask my wife who's a fool though) recipe that any novice smoker can master in no time!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8-12lb pork shoulder</li>
        <li>Rub of your choice (we love meat church's honey hog hot)</li>
        <li>Pan large enough to fit your meat</li>
        <li>spray bottle with apple juice or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>Ice cold beer</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prehat your smoker to 225F</li>
        <li>Trim shoulder of any hard fat that wont render down in the cooking process</li>
        <li>Cover the shoulder in a generous amount of spice rub, this will help in creating that bark that will give us those caramalized crunchy bits in the end</li>
        <li>Place shoulder in pan onto the smoker and fire up your favourite Netflix show (and whatever else you got on you)</li>
        <li>Spritz the shoulder every 60-90 minutes with apple juice or ACV</li>
        <li>When shoulder reaches the magic IT of 165F wrap the pan and cover the shoulder with aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Once IT reaches 205F remove from smoker and place pan in a cooler covered in towels, or a preheated oven to 150F and allow to rest for 90 minutes</li>
        <li>remove foil, pour off excess juices into a cup and keep on the side.</li> 
        <li>Carefully and perferably with gloves remove the shank, and begin to shred the pork, you can add more seasoning and re-add some juices if desired.</li>
    </ol>
